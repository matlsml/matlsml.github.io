excerpt: 'The dispersion characteristics of graphene oxide (GO) platelets in various dispersion media, as well as the effect of these media on the final morphological and physico-chemical properties of graphene oxide-based thin films are examined. The Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) model is used for ranking the dispersants and a comparison between the resulting mean GO platelet sizes is made using dynamic light scattering measurements. Contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are employed to characterize the GO and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) thin films produced from each dispersion medium. Water, a frequently used GO dispersion medium, is not found to be among those that produced the highest GO surface coverages. The results of this paper demonstrate the subtle and broad...'
